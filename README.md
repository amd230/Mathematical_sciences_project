Whilst video calling has always been popular, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a major shift to virtual communication through video calling platforms, 
such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, as opposed to face-to-face conversation. The benefit to video calling, as opposed to an audio call, is that you can 
see body language and interpret non-verbal cues, however, video calls are more susceptible to delays, which could impair the participants experience. 
These delays can often make it hard to establish a smooth, free-flowing conversation in this virtual setting. 

The aim of this paper is to model virtual conversations, investigate the dynamics and look at how delays have an impact on this. Within this repository is 
all the matlab code that was used to explore the dynamics of our model and produce the plots in the final paper. 

Please note, the code requires DDE-BIFTOOL to be downloaded prior to running.
